## Project Background 
This project for FreshMart focuses on improving operations, marketing, and customer satisfaction by analyzing sales and customer data. We will identify peak hours to optimize staff schedules, evaluate the loyalty program to see if it drives value, target marketing more effectively based on purchasing patterns, and assess high-value customer satisfaction to enhance their experience. The insights from this analysis will help reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve overall customer loyalty.

## Project Objective 
i.	 Identify the busiest times in each location and make sure staff are scheduled appropriately to reduce overtime costs and shorten customer wait times.
ii.	Analyze whether members spend more or provide additional benefits compared to regular customers to decide if the program is worth continuing
iii.	Study who buys each product category so that marketing efforts are focused on the right audience and the budget is used effectively.
iv.	Examine whether high-spending customers are satisfied and take steps to improve their experience to maintain their loyalty.

## Datasets 

**Patients.csv ** -  invoice id, branch, city, customer type, gender, payment, product line, unit price, quantity, tax 5%, total, cogs, gross margin %, date, and time.
--- 
## Dashboard Features 
-	Key KPIs: Total Sales, Number of Transactions, Average Sales  
-	The visuals include column, clustered, stacked, and bar charts covering Premium Customer Experience, Member Revenue Analysis by City and Branch, Staff Scheduling by City, Member vs Normal Customer Analysis, and Product Preference and Demographics.
-	Interactivity: slicers for Product Line, City and Customer Type
--- 
## Key Findings
1.	Membership data reveals that members make more transactions, but normal customers buy higher quantities and have higher average spending per visit.
2.	The analysis shows peak activity hours differ by location, with Austin busiest at hour 17, Chicago at hour 9, and New York at hour 20, matching their branch patterns.
3.	Health & Beauty shows a balanced interest with 1,743 females and 1,741 males, while Electronics has a slight male lead with 1,816 males compared to 1,730 females.
4.	Members generally give slightly higher satisfaction ratings than Normal customers, but ratings for both groups are spread across the scale.

--- 
## Recommendations 
1.	To fix the staffing mismatch, schedules should match each city’s peak hours, employees should be cross-trained, and rosters should be updated using actual invoice patterns.
2.	Since Members have more transactions but Normal customers spend more and buy more items, the membership program should be reviewed for ROI, high-spending normal customers should be targeted for conversion, and communication should be tailored to each group based on their spending behavior
3.	Marketing should focus on the right gender for each category, spend more on products that sell the most, and reduce ads for groups that rarely buy.
4.	Focus on improving the premium experience for Members to increase high-end satisfaction and reduce variation in ratings.
